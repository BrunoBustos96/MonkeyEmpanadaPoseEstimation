## Abstract
Creating large datasets of individual and group behavior is a necessary step towards a more ecological and dynamic understanding of primate behavior and cognition. RGB cameras are a non-invasive and non-costly technology to analyze behavior . Large datasets, however, present the challenge of annotating large amounts of frames. Recent studies show convolutional neural network can be used in pose estimation to aid tracking behavior both in artificial and ecological settings. Here we analyse the performance of a U-Net(69M parameters) and a Nested U-Net(9M parameters) to track Japanese macaque pose in 50k images in the wild. Both architectures performed with similar accuracy (73%) in key-point estimation. Changes in the number of filters and layers show no significant improvement after ten epochs. An overview of the results suggests both the number of skeletons in a frame and body size should be included in the models to further improve accuracy. Overall, this study shows that, despite the complexity in natural images, general CNNs are reliable to estimate monkey pose in the wild. More complex and tailor-made architectures are promising tools to study primate behavior.
